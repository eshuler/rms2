<b>NASCAR and IRL:</b><br/> Display : <b>Waving</b> at the Starter’s stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;The red flag may be used to indicate a pre-determined pause in the race, such as NASCAR's Budweiser Shootout or the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race.&nbsp;&nbsp;In these cases, the cars are directed to the pit area where cars may be worked on to the extent the race rules allow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a red flag or board, sometimes with a yellow
