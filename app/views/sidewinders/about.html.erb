	History of the name: by <b>Vic Kuklin</b><br/>
	In 1974, when the only region in these parts was the Colorado Region, Continental Divide Raceway was closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The only track left in the state was Aspen Raceway, which at a length of only 1.1 miles was great fun but not legal for national 
	races.&nbsp;&nbsp;Colorado Region decided to go back to the old airport at LaJunta for national races.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray Brumfield and I marked the 
	new pavement edge in corner 4 for the paving crew.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the year because our now 38-year-old daughter was driving the course 
	on her "tyke bike" which she sat on and pushed along.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, she rode the front straight of Pueblo Motorsports Park on 
	her tricycle at the age of five before it was paved.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that our first race at LaJunta was Labor Day weekend 
	of 1974.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the corner workers called themselves the "Colorado Border Patrol" and we all wore white jackets 
	with a big "Border Patrol" logo on the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;The story is that on Saturday night of the race weekend, some of us visited 
	one of LaJuntaâ€™s "watering holes" and after sitting at the bar for a few minutes in our white jackets, 
	we noticed that all of the other patrons had fled.&nbsp;&nbsp;A meeting was held and we decided to change our name.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, 
	The Leapin Lizards were well-known corner workers from Kansas.&nbsp;&nbsp;We needed something to compete with Lizards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, sidewinders 
	can be found along roadsides and are known to eat lizards (never mind that the sidewinders on the side of the road were usually the flat ones).
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;So the name "Rocky Mountain Sidewinders" was selected and someone (can't remember who) designed our new 
	patch .&nbsp;&nbsp;Tradition has been that upon receiving a divisional F&amp;C license in the Rocky Mountain Division, a worker 
	was awarded a Sidewinder patch.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest, as they say, is history.
